## Overview

This project investigates how public sentiment expressed in financial news and social media relates to movements in the U.S. stock market. Recent studies and real-world events have shown that collective emotions—such as optimism, fear, or uncertainty—can influence short-term trading behavior and market volatility. Understanding this relationship is valuable for investors, analysts, and policymakers who seek to interpret non-traditional data sources as signals of market dynamics.  

The project aims to systematically measure this connection using real-world open datasets and reproducible data workflows.

The goal of this project is to quantify the relationship between daily sentiment and stock market performance, using the S&P 500 index as a benchmark. Sentiment scores will be extracted from financial headlines and social media posts using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as TextBlob. Stock data will be obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. By aligning and analyzing both datasets over time, the project aims to identify whether sentiment polarity correlates with daily market returns.

Ultimately, this work will demonstrate how open data and reproducible workflows can be combined to explore real-world financial phenomena. The findings may provide evidence of emotional bias in trading patterns and highlight the growing role of data science and machine learning in financial analysis.  
This project also reflects key principles from the IS477 course, including data acquisition, integration, quality assessment, and reproducibility.

## Research Questions

1. Does public sentiment extracted from financial news or social media correlate with daily changes in the S&P 500 index?  
2. Can sentiment polarity (positive or negative tone) predict short-term stock market direction, such as the next day’s return?  
3. Are days with extreme sentiment—either highly optimistic or pessimistic—associated with higher market volatility or trading volume?
